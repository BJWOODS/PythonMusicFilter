# Python Music Filter
This filter made in Python converts any MP3 file into a horror film themed MP3 song by modifying the pitch, tremble, and bass of original soundtrack. 
Concept Eg.
Input: RedHotChiliPeppers.mp3
Output: (In Garage Band) -> Horror song made from the same notes used in the RedHotChilliPeppers.mp3 file
